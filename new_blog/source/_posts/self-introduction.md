#### Self Introduction

My name is Jason Zeng, a junior machine learning engineer worked in Kuaishou Corporation last year. For the first half of the year, I was working as an intern in search scene of HashTag. My major target is to improve the ranking result by comparing query-photo relevance. While in the second half of the year, I became a full time employer in search scene of Electric Commerce. My major work is focus on the recall and coarse-grained ranking stage.

Prior to working, I gained my bachelor degree in University of Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing, and then I pursue my Ph.D. study in University of California, San Diego. In 2020, I quit my Ph.D. programme and went back to China with master degree.

That's all for my introduction, thank you.
